    "I led the development of the design system and the interactive prototypes, using Figma Variables to flesh out interaction insights in our initial designs.",
    "Notable features include a personalized onboarding experience, live & crowdsourced washroom updates, and a system-prompted review tab with saved data. The result is a platform that provides real-time, friction-less, and tailored information on washroom amenities, access updates, and community sentiments, all in one place."
